# API Testing with Postman – Restful-booker

## 📌 Project Description
This repository presents a complete example of REST API testing using Postman and JavaScript-based tests. The project is based on the public Restful-booker API, which is commonly used for learning and practicing API testing. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate API testing skills, proper test design and documentation, usage of Postman environments, positive and negative test scenarios, and basic automation with reporting.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Postman
- JavaScript (Postman Tests)

## 🌐 API Test
Restful-booker API – public REST API for testing purposes  
Base URL: https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/

## :bulb: All documentation and testing steps are described in an open project on the Jira:
[restful-booker-jira-project](https://privaterelay-team-b8h6y4a3.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/TESTS/boards/35?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNDcwNWRiZmFkNGQ5NDk1Nzg3MWNlZDMzOGEzZTMzZmQiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)

## 🧪 Scope of Testing
- Functional API tests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- test scenarios
- test cases
- test bug's
- test report
- HTTP status code validation
- Response body validation
- Basic performance checks
- Usage of environment variable
- test scripts


## ▶️ How to Run Tests in Postman
1. Open Postman
2. Import the collection from [collection](https://github.com/MaciejMatch/API-Testing-in-Postman/blob/main/Booking.postman_collection.json)
3. Import the environment from [environment](https://github.com/MaciejMatch/API-Testing-in-Postman/blob/main/token.postman_environment.json)
4. Select the environment and run tests manually or using the Collection Runner
